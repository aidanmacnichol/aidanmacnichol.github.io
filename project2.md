# CMOS Characterization

This project was done during my co-op term at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) at the Herzberg Astronomy and Astrophysics research Center (HAA) in Victoria BC. 

## Background 

This work was done for the Dragonfly Telephoto Array:

The array currently uses an array of CCD sensors attached to Canon lenses. It is used to research ultra-low surface brightness structures at visible wavelengths. 

Unfortunately CCD sensors are a dying technology, replaced by the widely used CMOS sensors.
