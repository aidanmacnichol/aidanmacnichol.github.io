## Embedded

### [Real Time Drone Trajectory Prediction](/embedded-projects/droneTrajectory.html)
* Optimized system to run at 30 Hz real time on a **Raspberry Pi 5** with a **Hailo ML Edge processor**.
* Implemented a **Kalman filter** to model and predict drone movements.


### [Bare Metal Watch](/embedded-projects/bareMetalWatch.html)
* Designed and built a wristwatch based around a **AVR** microcontroller.
* Designed and soldered a PCB using **KiCad.**   

### [CMOS Characterization](/embedded-projects/CMOScharacterization.html)
* Developed experiments in **C++/Python** to characterize CMOS sensors for astronomical use.

## Software

### [Neuron Image Segmentation](/software-projects/neuronSegmentation.html)
* Implemented a **U-Net** based **CNN** in **PyTorch** to segment neuron dendrites photographed using pseudo 3D imaging. 
* Supplemented CNN with classical **morphological/filtering** techniques to improve accuracy. 

### [ARM Based SIMD Motion Estimation](/software-projects/ARMbasedSIMDMotionEstimation.html)
* Utilized inline **assembly** in **C** to optimize video encoding with **SIMD** instructions.
