# Facial Recognition Tempature Sentry - 2023
This was apart of my Capstone project in undergrad. The idea of the project was to automatically detect a person, center a contactless thermometer on their forehead and measure their body tempature. 

This was a COVID adjacent project and use cases would be in populated places like airports to help reduce the spread of infectious deseases. 

## Skills 
- Linux (RaspberryPi)
- Embedded (Servos, sensors, LCD, I2C)
- Python (OpenCV)
