# FPV Drone - 2016 
For this project I constructed a first person view (FPV) quadcopter. It was based around the **OpenPilot CC3D** flight control board. It was not too complex of a project; mainly just soldering everything together and tuning the control board. 

As the project was from a long time ago I only have a timelapse of me constructing it. 

## Skills
- Soldering
- Avionics
